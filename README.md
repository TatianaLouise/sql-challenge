# Challenge instructions
For this project, I designed and created tables to hold the data from 6 csv files containing data on employees of a company during the 1980s adn 1990s. Then, I imported the csv files into a sql database, and answered various questions about the data. 
That is, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Data Modeling and Engineering
I created an ERD using QuickDBD (QuickDBD-sql-challenge.png located in the EmployeeSQL folder) and imported each csv file into its corresponding sql table.

# Data Analysis
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
